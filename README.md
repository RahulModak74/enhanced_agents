# Enhanced Multi-Agent System (For Linux Operating System)

A modular system for orchestrating AI agents with persistent memory, dynamic behavior, and structured output parsing. Extremely simple and inbuilt support for CyberSecurity.

We have designed it on lines of langchain. So you can quickly get the hang of agentic work and test withn days and upgrade to LangChain step by step.

Features: Memory, Dynamic Agents, Strcutured Output parsing

To Add(Deliberately Ommited for simplicity):Tool integration, streaming, chain types & reasoning patterns, streaming, vectorization and embeddings.

Sample Marketing Agentic Workflow: (First YOU NEED TO GET free API token  for DeepSeek on operouter and add it in config.py)

Clone the repo and run:

python3 main.py --workflow cust_jour_workflow.json


Sample Cyber Security Agentic Workflow:

Clone the repo and run:

python3 main.py --workflow enhanced_workflow.json


## Features

1. **Memory Management**
   - Persistent conversation context between agents and across sessions
   - SQLite-based memory storage with flexible querying
   - Memory contexts automatically added to prompts

2. **Dynamic Agent Behavior**
   - Agents can choose their next actions based on task requirements
   - Branching workflows that adapt based on agent decisions
   - Decision-based delegation to specialized agents

3. **Structured Output Parsing**
   - JSON schema validation for structured agent outputs
   - Markdown section validation for document outputs
   - Automatic extraction and structuring of agent responses

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RahulModak74/enhanced_agents.git
cd multi-agent-system

# Install dependencies
pip install jsonschema

# Make the main script executable
chmod +x main.py
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

```bash
./main.py
```

This launches the interactive command-line interface where you can:

- Create agents: `create agent1 [model] [type]`
- Run agents: `run agent1 What is the risk score? [file] data.csv [memory:risk] [format:json]`
- Execute workflows: `workflow example_workflow.json`
- Access memory: `memory get risk_assessment` or `memory list`
- List agents: `list`
- Get agent outputs: `get agent1`

### Workflow Mode

```bash
./main.py --workflow example_workflow.json
```

This executes a pre-defined workflow directly without entering the interactive shell.

## Workflow Configuration

Workflows are defined as JSON arrays of agent execution steps:

```json
[
  {
    "agent": "agent1",
    "content": "Analyze this data...",
    "file": "data.csv",
    "output_format": {
      "type": "json",
      "schema": {
        "score": "number",
        "reasoning": "string"
      }
    },
    "memory_id": "analysis"
  },
  {
    "agent": "dynamic_agent",
    "type": "dynamic",
    "initial_prompt": "Decide what to do next...",
    "readFrom": ["agent1"],
    "memory_id": "analysis",
    "actions": {
      "action1": {
        "agent": "agent2",
        "content": "Follow-up task..."
      },
      "action2": {
        "agent": "agent3",
        "content": "Alternative task..."
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Memory System

The memory system uses SQLite to store:

- Agent outputs with metadata and timestamps
- Conversation contexts for multi-turn interactions
- Memory contexts that can be shared across agents

## Extending the System

### Adding New Agent Types

Create a new class that inherits from `Agent` or `DynamicAgent`:

```python
class SpecializedAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name, model=CONFIG["default_model"], memory_manager=None):
        super().__init__(name, model, memory_manager)
        # Custom initialization
    
    def special_execution(self, content, **kwargs):
        # Custom execution logic
        return result
```

### Adding New Output Formats

Extend the `OutputParser` class with new format handlers:

```python
@staticmethod
def extract_custom_format(text, output_format):
    # Custom format extraction logic
    return structured_data
```

For routine use cases, this modular multi-agent system achieves approximately 70-75% feature parity with LangChain's agent orchestration capabilities. Here's a breakdown of where it stands compared to LangChain:

**What it has (70-75% parity):**

1. **Core Agent Orchestration (90%)** - The system handles sequential agent execution, context sharing, and dynamic routing comparable to LangChain's basic chains and agents.

2. **Memory Management (85%)** - The SQLite-based memory system provides persistent storage across sessions and comprehensive memory retrieval, similar to LangChain's memory systems.

3. **Structured Output Parsing (80%)** - JSON schema validation and structured output extraction handle most common output parsing needs.

4. **Dynamic Behavior (75%)** - The dynamic agent's ability to choose paths and route information offers similar functionality to LangChain's ReAct agents.

5. **Command Line Interface (90%)** - The CLI provides comparable usability to LangChain's basic interfaces.

**What it's missing (Delibearte for simplicity):**

1. **Tool Integration (40% parity)** - No built-in integration with external tools, APIs, or services. LangChain provides dozens of pre-built tool connections.

2. **Vector Storage (0% parity)** - No vector embedding or semantic search capabilities, which are essential for RAG workflows in LangChain.

3. **Advanced Chain Types (30% parity)** - Missing specialized patterns like MapReduce, summarization chains, or extraction chains.

4. **Streaming Support (0% parity)** - No streaming response handling for real-time output.

5. **Observability & Tracing (20% parity)** - Basic logging but lacks the comprehensive tracing and debugging tools of LangChain.

6. **Document Processing (10% parity)** - Very basic file handling without document chunking, embedding, or advanced processing.

For routine agent orchestration where you primarily need agents to work together, share context, make decisions, and maintain state, this system would handle 70-75% of use cases. For more advanced scenarios involving semantic search, specialized tools, or complex document processing, you'd need to add those capabilities or switch to LangChain.
